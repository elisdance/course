 <h4> <b>Introduction</b><br></h4>
 <p>
  Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions, they've <br>
  moved to <u>their own section.</u> Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and  <br>
  more!<br>

  <h4 ><b>Core Components</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs <br>
  native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the <br>
  appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more <br> 
  about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native. <br>

  <h4 ><b> React Fundamentals</b> <br></h4>
  <p>
  React Native runs on <u>React</u> , a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most <br> 
  of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.<br>
  
  We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:<br>
  
  <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need <br>
  names and a cafe to work in.<br>
  
  <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: &lt Text &gt Hello, I am <br>
   your cat!  &lt /Text &gt. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is <br> 
   JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with <br> 
   curly braces inside &lt Text &gt.<br>
  
  <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. <br>
  
  <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a <br> 
  component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user <br> 
  interaction. State gives your components memory!<br>
  </p>
</div>
<div id="handling">
  <h4 ><b>Handling Text Input</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to<br>
  be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is<br>
  submitted.<br>
  
  For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new <br>
  language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï <br>
   üçï".<br>
